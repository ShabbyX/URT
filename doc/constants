Certain constants used within URT are values set during configuration and build.  The following constants are the limits to what the user can give
to URT functions.

CONST_GROUP Limits
	Limits to certain sizes or other values

	These constants are limits to various features of URT.

	CONSTANT URT_NAME_LEN: 6
		Maximum length of a name

		This is the maximum length of a name used for sharing objects. URT never reads or writes more than this many characters on names.
		This means that the name does not need to be NUL-terminated. It also means that URT does not NUL-terminate the name.

	CONSTANT URT_MIN_PRIORITY
		Minimum possible priority in the system

		This is the minimum possible priority in the system. Note that the integer value of this priority may in fact be higher than
		`[#URT_MAX_PRIORITY]`. Use `[#urt_priority_is_higher](urt_task_attr)` to compare priorities.

	CONSTANT URT_MAX_PRIORITY
		Maximum possible priority in the system

		This is the maximum possible priority in the system. Note that the integer value of this priority may in fact be lower than
		`[#URT_MIN_PRIORITY]`. Use `[#urt_priority_is_higher](urt_task_attr)` to compare priorities.

	CONSTANT URT_MORE_PRIORITY
		Value to be added to priority to increase it

		If this value is added to a [valid](urt_task_attr#urt_priority_is_valid) priority and if the result is still a valid priority,
		then the result would have a higher priority than the original one, unless no higher priority is possible. Similarly, subtracting
		this value from a priority results in lower priority, unless no lower priority is possible. The `[#urt_priority](urt_task_attr)`
		is a convenience function to get the nth highest priority.
