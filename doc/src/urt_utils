Functions of this module provide miscellaneous utilities.

FUNCTION urt_get_free_name: (name: char[URT_NAME_LEN]): int
	Get and reserve an unused name

	This function finds an unused name, fills it in **`name`** and reserves it.

	Currently, the function generates unique names that cannot be used by the user. This makes the function faster, but also implies
	that it is limited to slightly less than 70 million names before failing. It has been decided that such a number will not be reached
	in any application. If it does, please file a report to extend the function. In any case, one can try asking for an object with names
	generated in a loop and try until a free name is found.

	INPUT name
		A new name available to be used as a shared object name.
	OUTPUT
		Returns `[#URT_SUCCESS](constants)` or `[#URT_FAIL](constants)` based on whether a name was available or not.

FUNCTION urt_is_rt_context: (): bool
	Whether calling thread is in real-time context

	A call to this function determines whether the calling thread is in real-time context, and therefore can call URT functions or not.

	OUTPUT
		Returns `true` if the calling thread is in real-time context.
