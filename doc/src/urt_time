Functions of this module handle timing information.

TYPE urt_time: int64_t
	Value of time in nanoseconds

	This type represents time from an unknown origin in nanoseconds resolution. Alternatively, it may denote a duration
	in time.

FUNCTION urt_get_time: (): urt_time
	Get current time

	This function retrieves the current time (from an unknown origin) in nanoseconds.

	OUTPUT
		Current time in nanoseconds.

FUNCTION urt_get_exec_time: (): urt_time
NOTICE RT
	Get execution time

	This function retrieves execution time of the current thread since it's beginning.

	On some systems this operation may not be available. In such a case, `[#urt_get_time]` is used. Therefore, it
	is advised to take the value of `urt_get_exec_time` at the beginning of the thread and subtract it from the
	output of this function and use _that_ value as the execution time. Currently, this operation switches to
	`urt_get_time` in the following case(s):

		- In POSIX systems where `CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID` is not defined.

	Note: In POSIX systems, please read the man page for `clock_gettime`, information regarding `CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID`
	and `CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID`. In some systems, these clocks don't play well with task migration among CPUs.

	OUTPUT
		Execution time of the calling thread, possibly _not_ starting from zero.

FUNCTION urt_sleep: (t: urt_time): void
	Sleep for some time

	This function suspends execution time of the calling thread for _at least_ **`t`** nanoseconds.

	INPUT t
		Requested time to sleep in nanoseconds.
