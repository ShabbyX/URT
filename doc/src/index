# Introduction

Unified Real-Time Interface (URT) is a simple interface to various real-time systems currently in existence. That is,
the same application could be ported to different real-time back-ends, such as RTAI, QNX, VxWorks etc. Additionally,
a non-real-time Linux back-end is also provided to facilitate testing and development on non-real-time platforms, using
tools such as valgrind that may not be compatible with certain real-time features.

## Modules

Currently, URT is in a very early development stage. Therefore, the functions in these modules may radically change.
Please refer to the documentation on each module for their respective functions.

- [Setup module](urt)
- [Time module](urt_time)
- [Thread module](urt_thread)
- [Memory module](urt_mem)
- [Lock module](urt_lock)

## Shared Resources

Shared resources in URT are identified by at-most-6-character names, comprising of capital letters (`'A'-'Z'`), digits (`'0'-'9'`)
and underscore (`'\_'`). At most 6 characters are read from the name string. Therefore, a 6-character name doesn't need to be
NUL-terminated. If NUL or an invalid character is reached before the 6 characters, the name is truncated to that length.
