Constants in URT are divided in 2 groups:
- Limits
- Meta

CONST_GROUP Limits
	Limits to certain sizes or other values

	These constants are limits to various features of URT.

	CONSTANT URT_NAME_LEN: 6
		Maximum length of a name

		This is the maximum length of a name used for sharing objects. URT never reads or writes more than this many characters on names.
		This means that the name does not need to be NUL-terminated. It also means that URT does not NUL-terminate the name.

	CONSTANT URT_MIN_PRIORITY
		Minimum possible priority in the system

		This is the minimum possible priority in the system. Note that the integer value of this priority may in fact be higher than
		`[#URT_MAX_PRIORITY]`. Use `[#urt_priority_is_higher](urt_task_attr)` to compare priorities.

	CONSTANT URT_MAX_PRIORITY
		Maximum possible priority in the system

		This is the maximum possible priority in the system. Note that the integer value of this priority may in fact be lower than
		`[#URT_MIN_PRIORITY]`. Use `[#urt_priority_is_higher](urt_task_attr)` to compare priorities.

	CONSTANT URT_MORE_PRIORITY
		Value to be added to priority to increase it

		If this value is added to a [valid](urt_task_attr#urt_priority_is_valid) priority and if the result is still a valid priority,
		then the result would have a higher priority than the original one, unless no higher priority is possible. Similarly, subtracting
		this value from a priority results in lower priority, unless no lower priority is possible.

CONST_GROUP Meta
	Constants providing information about the API

	These are constants that give information about the API itself.

	CONSTANT URT_SYS_LINUX
		Indicates Linux back-end

		If defined, Linux is the back-end of the API

	CONSTANT URT_SYS_RTAI_KERNEL
		Indicates RTAI (kernel space) back-end

		If defined, RTAI is the back-end of the API (in kernel space)

	CONSTANT URT_SYS_RTAI_USER
		Indicates RTAI (user space) back-end

		If defined, RTAI is the back-end of the API (in user space)

	CONSTANT URT_SYS_QNX
		Indicates QNX back-end

		If defined, QNX is the back-end of the API

	CONSTANT URT_SYS_VXWORKS
		Indicates VxWorks back-end

		If defined, VxWorks is the back-end of the API

	CONSTANT URT_VERSION_MAJOR: 0
		The major number of the version of the API

		The major number in the version. This number changes only in case of fundamental changes in the API.

	CONSTANT URT_VERSION_MINOR: 4
		The minor number of the version of the API

		The minor number in the version. This number increases with added functionality or partial changes in the library.

	CONSTANT URT_VERSION_REVISION: 0
		The revision number of the version of the API

		The revision number in the version. This number increases only when minor changes to the API take place while the
		overall functionality is the same. This includes bug-fixing, renaming functions and variables, added error-checking
		and such.

	CONSTANT URT_VERSION_BUILD: 292
		The build number of the version of the API

		This number shows how many times the API files have been all successfully compiled.

	CONSTANT URT_VERSION: "0.4.0.292"
		The complete version of the API as a string

		This number is merely a string concatenation of the previous four values in the following format:
		```URT_VERSION_MAJOR.URT_VERSION_MINOR.URT_VERSION_REVISION.URT_VERSION_BUILD```
