Constants in the skin are divided in 3 groups:
- Limits
- Return Values
- Flag Values
- Meta

CONST_GROUP Limits
	Limits to certain sizes

	These constants are limits to various features of URT.

	CONSTANT URT_NAME_LEN: 6
		Maximum length of a name

		This is the maximum length of a name used for sharing objects. URT never reads or writes more than this many characters on names.
		This means that the name does not need to be NUL-terminated. It also means that URT does not NUL-terminate the name.

CONST_GROUP Return Values
	Possible return values from the functions in the interface

	These are the possible return values from any function in the interface unless otherwise indicated. Throughout the API, any function
	that has a return value has its possible return values listed.

	CONSTANT URT_SUCCESS
		Return value of operations if successful

		A non-negative value indicating successful operation. Returned by the following functions:

			- `[#urt_TODO](urt_lock)`

		Function `[#urt_TODO](urt_error)` can be called to obtain possible warnings.

	CONSTANT URT_FAIL
		Return value of operations if failed

		A negative value indicating failed operation. Returned by the following functions:

		Function `[#urt_TODO](urt_error)` can be called to obtain error description.

CONST_GROUP Flag Values
	Values used as flags in the API

	These are constants that are used within the API as flags, either to flag a certain data, or as input to functions of the API.

CONST_GROUP Meta
	Constants providing information about the API

	These are constants that give information about the API itself.

	CONSTANT URT_SYS_LINUX
		Indicates Linux back-end

		If defined, Linux is the back-end of the API

	CONSTANT URT_SYS_RTAI_KERNEL
		Indicates RTAI (kernel space) back-end

		If defined, RTAI is the back-end of the API (in kernel space)

	CONSTANT URT_SYS_RTAI_USER
		Indicates RTAI (user space) back-end

		If defined, RTAI is the back-end of the API (in user space)

	CONSTANT URT_SYS_QNX
		Indicates QNX back-end

		If defined, QNX is the back-end of the API

	CONSTANT URT_SYS_VXWORKS
		Indicates VxWorks back-end

		If defined, VxWorks is the back-end of the API

	CONSTANT URT_VERSION_MAJOR: 0
		The major number of the version of the API

		The major number in the version. This number changes only in case of fundamental changes in the API.

	CONSTANT URT_VERSION_MINOR: 1
		The minor number of the version of the API

		The minor number in the version. This number increases with added functionality or partial changes in the library.

	CONSTANT URT_VERSION_REVISION: 0
		The revision number of the version of the API

		The revision number in the version. This number increases only when minor changes to the API take place while the
		overall functionality is the same. This includes bug-fixing, renaming functions and variables, added error-checking
		and such.

	CONSTANT URT_VERSION_BUILD: 0
		The build number of the version of the API

		This number shows how many times the API files have been all successfully compiled.

	CONSTANT URT_VERSION: "0.1.0.0"
		The complete version of the API as a string

		This number is merely a string concatenation of the previous four values in the following format:
		```URT_VERSION_MAJOR.URT_VERSION_MINOR.URT_VERSION_REVISION.URT_VERSION_BUILD```
