These functions setup URT itself.

FUNCTION urt_init: (): int
	Initialize URT

	This function initializes URT. It must be called before any other function can be called (except `[#urt_recover]`).

	OUTPUT
		Returns one of the following:

		- `[#URT_SUCCESS](constants)` if successful,
		- `[#URT_ALREADY](constants)` if URT is already initialized,
		- `[#URT_NO_MEM](constants)` if out of memory,
		- `[#URT_FAIL](constants)` otherwise.

FUNCTION urt_exit: (): void
	Free URT

	This function frees resources allocated by URT. It must be called before program exit.

FUNCTION urt_recover: (): void
	Recover from bad state due to crash

	If a program crashes, it may leave some internal shared entities, such as locks in a bad state. This function
	will try to recover from such cases. The function may not be able to completely recover the system if the
	damage is too severe, though.

	It is important for this function to be called when no users of URT are present. Otherwise, it is impossible to
	understand whether the current state of the system is due to a normal usage of URT by another user or a previous
	crash. Therefore, calling this function while another user is present may likely corrupt the system.

	Note: `urt_init` should **not** need to be called before this function.
