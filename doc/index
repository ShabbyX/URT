# Introduction

Unified Real-Time Interface (URT) is a simple interface to various real-time systems currently in existence. That is,
the same application could be ported to different real-time back-ends, such as RTAI, QNX, VxWorks etc. Additionally,
a non-real-time Linux back-end is also provided to facilitate testing and development on non-real-time platforms, using
tools such as valgrind that may not be compatible with certain real-time features.

## Modules

Currently, URT is in development stage. Therefore, the functions in these modules may change.
Please refer to the documentation on each module for their respective functions.

- [Setup module](urt)
- [Time module](urt_time)
- [Memory module](urt_mem)
- [Task module](urt_task)
- [Lock module](urt_lock)
- [Log module](urt_log)
- [Utilities](urt_utils)

See [style](Style) for general description of common usage styles among URT functions.
