TODO
- See if rtai's non-shared mutex should better be of type RES_SEM instead of BIN_SEM
- Document URT_MODULE_*
- See if there's a way to store URT_MODULE_* in user-space so that when printing help, they would be mentioned.

Known issues
- with linux
- with RTAI (user space)
- with RTAI (kernel space)
