TODO
- See if there's a way to store URT_MODULE_* in user-space so that when printing help, they would be mentioned.
- See if RTAI's exectime is correct
- Change the macro definition of functions to static inline!  Otherwise it would not be possible to take them as a function pointer,
  which could come as a surprise if somebody needs it.

Known issues
- with all
- with linux
- with RTAI (user space)
- with RTAI (kernel space)
