TODO
- See if rtai's non-shared mutex should better be of type RES_SEM instead of BIN_SEM. Shared or non-shared, see which one works with condition variables.
- See if there's a way to store URT_MODULE_* in user-space so that when printing help, they would be mentioned.
- See if RTAI's exectime is correct
- Add condition variables to RTAI
- Make DocThis! build and clean messages also short

Known issues
- with linux
- with RTAI (user space)
- with RTAI (kernel space)
