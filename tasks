TODO
- See if rtai's non-shared mutex should better be of type RES_SEM instead of BIN_SEM
- See if there's a way to store URT_MODULE_* in user-space so that when printing help, they would be mentioned.
- See if RTAI's exectime is correct
- Make soft real-time threads too
- Make DocThis! build and clean messages also short
- In double-space environments, like RTAI, have a function that can give the time difference between the calling
  space and a reference space, which in case of RTAI would be kernel space.  In other words, this function in kernel
  space would return zero, but in user-space communicates through a /sys file that reports back the time, similar to
  how Skinware used to do it.  Maybe make a calibration function called in initialization (URT_GLUE would do this)
  so that urt_get_time would automatically adjust the clock and there would be no reason for the user to know about
  it.  Yes, yes this is better.

Known issues
- with linux
- with RTAI (user space)
- with RTAI (kernel space)
